                <h2 class="content-title">Jimi Hendrix</h2>
                <p class="content-text">Jimi Hendrix was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career lasted only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".</p>
                <p class="content-text">Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, but was granted an exemption from service after injuring his ankle. He subsequently moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard. Hendrix achieved fame during the 1960s as a member of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, with whom he recorded three studio albums and one live album, before his death in 1970 at the age of 27.</p>

                <p class="content-text">Hendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal, a device that can produce expressive sounds and add texture to a guitar solo. Hendrix pioneered a number of guitar effects, including distortion, phasing, flanging, and vibrato. He was also skilled at using a variety of alternate tunings, including open tunings, to create new instrumental timbres.</p>

                                This is most likely the Olympic white Stratocaster that Jimi used when he left America and founded the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1966, meaning it was used between New York and the UK. There’s also a story that intertwines this guitar to an identical strat Hendrix allegedly borrowed from Keith Richards’ girlfriend, so it’s hard to tell which Olympic white Strat Jimi played during the foundation of The Experience and wielded as his main guitar during their first European tour. According to Linda Keith, Hendrix borrowed the guitar after smashing another white Stratocaster, but she never mentioned whether the guitar was returned or not.

                                An iconic set of Stratocasters that lived through the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s rise to stardom, Jimi bought two Sunburst Strats when he returned to London after touring the Newcastle and South Shield in Britain in 1967, reportedly these were a ’63 and a ’65 models that eventually propped a few of the icon’s most memorable performances. These Sunburst Strats gradually replaced the worn white Strat Hendrix initially went to England with and debuted on Chelmsford on February 25th, 1967. Also, if the stories align, one of these would become the first Stratocaster to ever be “sacrificed” or engulfed in flames after the band’s presentation at the Astoria Theater.

                                A truly mythical Stratocaster, arguably the most recognizable Hendrix guitar today. Before being sacrificed and burnt at the end of the Monterey Pop Festival, its debut is thought to date back to the Jimi Hendrix Experience appearance on the British TV Show, Top of the Pops in March. This Strat was originally solid red with a rosewood neck, and it made vague appearances until May of that same year when it was used as the main instrument for a brief European tour before Hendrix went to Monterey.
